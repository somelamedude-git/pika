This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Pika-Cool is a location-based scavenger hunt adventure! It tracks your real-world location and challenges you to find a random spot within a 10 km radius. Along the way, you’re assigned a Pokémon to catch.

When you reach the target location (automatically detected by the app), you’ll face a riddle. Solve it correctly and earn the Pokémon badge, your digital honor trophy! Fail, and it’s back to the hunt.

Get ready to explore, solve, and collect like a true Pokémon master!

(For the final product I will be integrating a backend as well, along with more gamification, the prototype is based on the basic features that pika-cool provides)
